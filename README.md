Calling to Decentralize Centralized Civilizations

Some civilizations are centralized. They have kings, who inherit their power from their fathers, stay in their thrones for life, and deprive the freedom of their people.

Some are decentralized. People vote their leaders for limited terms. No one deserved better because of their descent. There are diversity and competition.

If you prefer a certain level of decentralization, then this is a calling for you.
